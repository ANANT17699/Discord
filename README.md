🎧📹 Discord + Google Meet Inspired Web App

A frontend-focused capstone project that blends the real-time communication vibe of Discord with the video meeting structure of Google Meet. Built to demonstrate modern frontend development skills, UI design thinking, and component-based architecture.

🚀 Project Overview

This project is a web-based communication platform UI designed to simulate:

Discord-style chat layout and server/channel structure

Google Meet–like video meeting interface

A clean, responsive, and intuitive user experience

The goal of this capstone was to explore how popular communication platforms design their interfaces and workflows, and then reimagine them into a single unified frontend experience.
